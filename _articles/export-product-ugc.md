## Overview

Olapic offers a flat file CSV export solution (including basic product information and the associated best user generated content) for the purpose of external integrations that require user generated content from Olapic. The associated UGC product images included in the CSV will be curated by the client, and have rights & permissions obtained from the original user who generated the photo.

There are two choices in regards to the inclusion of product image(s) in the feed:
* The image with the highest Photorank score associated with the product. Photorank is Olapicâ€™s proprietary algorithm scoring system that predicts the success of a photo based on 40+ attributes.
* The image with the highest click-through rate (CTR).

Various CSV layouts are available; please see specifications below for different options.
