## Widget Instance Tag

### Static Widget Configuration

The following step-by-step will walk you through the necessarys steps required to configure a **static** type widget (i.e., widget showing content from a specific stream or category, or using the "All Photos" setting in the Olapic Widget Manager).

1. First, search for the Olapic tags in the Tags tab in the Tealium TMS, click the "+ Add" button next to the Olapic Widget Instance:

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
      <h4>Container div element must exist</h4>
      The container div with a specific ID that will hold the Olapic widget content is required in the DOM. If the element is not present on the the source level, use the <a href="https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/iQ-Tag-Management/Content-Modification-Extension/ta-p/12194>"><strong>Tealium Content Modification extension</strong></a> to inject the element dynamically.
    </div>
