# What is a Product Feed?

The Product Feed (sometimes referred to as "PF") is important because it unlocks many important features of the Olapic platform, such as: media syndication, shoppability, content organization, automatic updates, and more. Via the PF, we can import the product catalog data on your e-commerce website in an automated fashion. This includes product metadata such as: product name, product URL, product image URL, product availability, category information, etc.

When we process your Product Feed, each product from the Product Feed becomes a stream. You can think of streams as folders. When Olapic collects content on behalf of your brand, the content must be organized and tagged to different streams as they pass through the curation process. Once Olapic processes your Product Feed, you are able to tag the content to the streams that mirror the products from your Product Feed. The point being, youâ€™re matching the product that is represented in the user-generated image.

With the product streams created in your Olapic account and the content tagged to corresponding product streams, Olapic widgets implemented across your site can display the user-generated images, along with the products tagged to the content. Your site visitors can interact with the user-generated content and click on the tagged products to navigate to the corresponding product page. This helps drive click-through to product pages & ultimately lead the visitor to conversion.

While you can create the product streams manually in the Olapic dashboard, it's much harder to create a shoppable experience out of your user-generated content (UGC) in an automated fashion without the Product Feed, especially if your product catalog consists of hundreds to thousands of products. The Product Feed allows us to import your catalog at scale as well as maintain the most up-to-date state of your products.

**In short, here are main functions of a Product Feed:**

* **Stream Creation**

	Automatic product stream (folder) creation in the Olapic platform for each unique product on your product feed.
	Each stream will automatically include the name, product URL, image URL, and product ID (and any extra information) from your product feed.

* **Enable Shoppable Content**

	In order to make user-generated-content shoppable, it needs to be "tagged" to a product stream within the platform. Therefore, the product feed fuels the shoppable experience.
	The "Shop This Look" area of the media lightbox features tagged product streams and the product link.

* **Platform Sync**
	
	Olapic processes your Product Feed daily, which means our platform will stay in-sync with your product catalog data as changes are introduced on the e-commerce platform.
	
	Updates to the product names, product URLs or images can be made easily & automatically by the feed.

	Products can be added or removed or flagged as out of stock easily via the feed.

* **Multi-Account Setup**

	Product Feed integration is a pre-requisite of the multi-account structure.
	
	Images tagged to product streams in the master account can be synced with the related child accounts as long as the matching product streams exist on both master and child accounts.
